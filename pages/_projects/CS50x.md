[CS50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science) is a self-paced introductory course from Harvard University, presented by David J. Malan, Doug Lloyd and Brian Yu.


This is the first class I have taken in Computer Science and I am glad I took it. I learned so much throughout the class and it has given me a good base to learn more from. Professor David Malan is exceptional at inspiring even through video.

##### Syllabus
>Introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming. This course teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web programming. Languages include C, Python, and SQL plus HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Problem sets inspired by the arts, humanities, social sciences, and sciences. Course culminates in a final project. Designed for concentrators and non-concentrators alike, with or without prior programming experience. Two thirds of CS50 students have never taken CS before. Among the overarching goals of this course are to inspire students to explore unfamiliar waters, without fear of failure, create an intensive, shared experience, accessible to all students, and build community among students.
